## Dependencies:

None (built-in functions only)

## Description:

number_guessing.py is a Python script that generates a random number between 0 and 500. The player has to guess the correct number, and the game provides hints if the guess is too high or too low.

## Usage:

Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CarlosValerioM/Day-6-Number-Guessing-Game.git
```
Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd NumberGuessingGame
```
Run the script:
```bash
python NumberGuessingGame.py
```
The script will prompt you to enter a number, and it will provide feedback until you guess the correct number.

## Example Output:

Guess the number: 250

250 is too low!

Guess the number: 400

400 is too high!

Guess the number: 320

Congratulations! You won! The number is: 320

## How it works:

The script generates a random number between 0 and 500.

The user enters a guess.

If the guess is too high or too low, the script provides feedback.

The user continues guessing until they find the correct number.
